# Our Homeschooling Journey: Finding Connection Through Learning Together

When people ask me why we decided to homeschool our children, they often expect a story about dissatisfaction with the school system or religious convictions. While those are valid reasons many families choose this path, our story started differently—with a moment of connection.

## The Moment That Changed Everything

It was a regular Tuesday afternoon. Jackson, then six years old, had just returned from school. Instead of his usual energetic burst through the door, he walked in quietly, shoulders slumped. When I asked about his day, he mumbled, "I'm not smart enough for school, Mom."

My heart shattered. This brilliant, curious child who built intricate LEGO structures and asked profound questions about how the world worked had somehow received the message that he wasn't intelligent enough.

As we talked more, I discovered that his learning style—kinesthetic, creative, and nonlinear—wasn't meshing well with the classroom environment. He was struggling to sit still and absorb information in the prescribed format, and it was affecting not just his academic confidence but his sense of self-worth.

That night, Joshua and I stayed up late researching alternatives. What began as casual exploration quickly evolved into a serious consideration of homeschooling. We weren't just looking for a different educational method; we were seeking a way to preserve our son's natural love of learning and curiosity about the world.

## Taking the Leap

The decision wasn't easy. I had health challenges to manage, and the thought of being responsible for our children's education was intimidating. What if I failed them? What if they fell behind? What if they missed important social experiences?

But then I remembered something my mother had told me years earlier: "Education isn't about knowing all the answers; it's about knowing how to find them." I realized we didn't have to be perfect—we just needed to be committed to learning alongside our children.

We started with a six-month trial period. If it wasn't working for any of us, we'd reevaluate. I think that time boundary gave us the courage to try.

## Finding Our Rhythm

Those first few months were chaotic, to put it mildly. We swung between highly structured days that left everyone frustrated and completely unstructured days that left me anxious about whether any learning was happening. We tried curriculum packages that promised to make everything simple, only to abandon them when they didn't fit our children's learning styles.

Gradually, though, we found our rhythm. We discovered that:

- Mornings work best for focused academic work
- Learning happens most naturally through projects and real-world application
- Regular outdoor time isn't a luxury—it's essential for everyone's mental health
- Following interests leads to deeper, more retained learning than forcing topics
- Emotional regulation skills are just as important as academic content

We also learned that homeschooling isn't just about academics—it's about life skills, character development, and family relationships. Some of our most valuable "lessons" have happened while cooking dinner together, repairing something around the house, or having deep conversations during our morning nature walks.

## The Unexpected Blessings

While we initially chose homeschooling to better meet our children's educational needs, we've discovered so many unexpected blessings along the way:

### Deeper Family Relationships

Spending so much time together has strengthened our family bonds in ways I never imagined. We truly know our children—their strengths, struggles, passions, and fears. They know us too—not just as parents but as whole people with our own interests and challenges.

### Customized Education

Jackson's passion for 3D printing has become a portal to learning mathematics, engineering, design, entrepreneurship, and communication skills. Finley's love of drama and visual arts has developed her emotional intelligence alongside her creativity. They're not just learning facts—they're developing their unique gifts.

### Flexibility Around Health Needs

My autoimmune conditions mean I have good days and difficult ones. Homeschooling has allowed us to adapt our schedule around health realities—working ahead on my good days, focusing on independent learning or audiobooks on harder days, and taking field trips when we all need a change of pace.

### Expanded Community

Contrary to the stereotype of isolated homeschoolers, we've connected with a diverse, supportive community of other families. Our children interact with people of all ages and backgrounds—not just their same-age peers—preparing them for the real-world social dynamics they'll encounter throughout life.

## The Challenges

I would never want to paint an unrealistically rosy picture of homeschooling. It has very real challenges:

- There are days when everyone is cranky, no one wants to learn, and I question all my life decisions
- Finding time for self-care and personal interests requires intentional planning
- The mental load of being responsible for your children's education can be heavy
- Financial sacrifices come with having one parent focused on home education
- Administrative tasks like record-keeping aren't exactly thrilling

But even on the hardest days, I've never regretted our decision. The challenges have stretched us and helped us grow as individuals and as a family.

## What I Wish I'd Known

Looking back on our journey so far, there are things I wish someone had told me at the beginning:

1. **Trust the process.** Learning isn't linear. There will be apparent plateaus followed by sudden leaps of understanding.

2. **Don't compare.** Not to traditional schools, not to other homeschooling families, not even between your own children.

3. **Community matters.** Find your people—whether local or online—who understand and support your journey.

4. **Take care of yourself.** You can't pour from an empty cup. Your well-being is a vital part of successful homeschooling.

5. **Stay flexible.** What works this year (or even this month) might not work next time. Be willing to adapt.

6. **Document the journey.** Take pictures, save projects, write down funny moments and meaningful conversations. These are the real treasures of your homeschooling journey.

7. **Remember your "why."** On difficult days, return to the reasons you chose this path in the first place.

## The Ongoing Journey

Homeschooling isn't a static decision—it's an evolving journey that looks different in each season of family life. As our children grow and their needs change, our approach continues to adapt.

What remains constant is our commitment to nurturing their natural love of learning, helping them discover and develop their unique gifts, and building strong family relationships that will support them throughout their lives.

I don't know what the future holds. We take each year as it comes, evaluating what's best for each child and for our family as a whole. But I do know that choosing to learn together has been one of the most challenging and rewarding decisions we've ever made.

If you're considering homeschooling or just beginning your journey, remember that there's no one "right way" to do it. Your family's path will be uniquely yours, with its own challenges and joys. Trust yourself, stay curious, and enjoy the journey of learning alongside your children.
